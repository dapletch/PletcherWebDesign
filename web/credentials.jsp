            <h1>Credentials</h1>
            <p>I first delved into the world of web design by taking a Web Development, as a dual enrollment class, during my senior year at Brattleboro Union High School. Needless to say, I fell in love. As the semester progressed, so did my skills in web design. I later took those skills and applied through out my college career, while attending Castleton University in the Computer Information Systems (CIS) program. </p>

            <p>While in college I created two websites that later went live. The first website that I created was the local Sigma Delta Chi Fraternity. The fraternityâ€™s website started out as a series of static HTML pages that only provided information about the fraternity, and nothing more. As time progressed, I added some JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, for more dynamic features. The MySQL database that I created has helped countless alumni reconnect with one another. I also worked along side with the acting treasurer at the time to set up a PayPal account. Once the PayPal account was all set up and launched on the website, thousands of dollars of donations starting coming through, but I didn't stop there.</p>

            <p>I then added WordPress as a sub directory, so the fraternity would have it's own blog. After WordPress was successfully installed the fraternity was able to launch a massive online marketing campaign for their parties, and other social events that they were hosting. This enhanced ability to market themselves allowed them to raise $600 for the Make a Wish Foundation. You can see my work at <a href="http://www.sigmadeltachicsc.com/" id="past_projects">sigmadeltachicsc.com</a>.</p>

            <p>The second website that I created while enrolled in an internship, for the start up skin care company, Skin and Tonic. I met with the owner, Charlene Palfey, and came up with a plan to use WordPress as the content management system to be able to create the site. I searched for templates and gave her list of options that I thought would be able to suit her needs. After some time and consideration, we finally found a template that would give her site the look and feel a real care company. I manipulated the template to incorporate the graphical content that she had previously acquired, through Green Screen Graphics in Rutland, VT. Once I had all the content creating the website was a breeze. I then consulted Charlene to hash out the final details, for the domain and hosting, and came up with <a href="http://www.skinandtonic.care/" id="past_projects">skinandtonic.care</a>, as the domain name.</p>

            <p>I have recently just finished creating another website, for an up-and-coming artist, by the name of Marilyn Allen. I consulted with over the course of two months, while developing her site on the popular web platform WIX. Marilyn having an artists eye was very particular on the look and feel of her site. She wanted a professional, fully functional, yet a simplistic website that wouldn't draw attention away from her art. I then wrote up some documentation, as an instructive guide to assist her in maintaining her own website, <a href="http://www.marilynallenfineart.com/" id="past_projects">marilynallenfineart.com</a>. It is because of these past success stories that I have pursued the career of web design and development. I am looking forward from hearing from you, the client, to assist you in achieving your own success.</p>

            <p>I am now currently employed as a Programmer Analyst at Holstein Association USA, Inc. in Brattleboro, VT. I work on the Holstein's web applications, which are primarily coded in Java, while using Java Servlet Pages (JSP's) to create dynamic web pages, that the Holstein Association's customers use to access the 20 million plus records of genomic data that the Association possesses. I have gained much experience in the field of web design and development since then, and I am greatful to have such an opportunity.</p>
